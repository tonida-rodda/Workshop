# Setup

## Python & Flask

In this workshop, we will create an HTTP REST server using Python.
First of all, you have make sure you have [**python 3.7** or higher installed](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu).

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```sh
python --version
> Python 3.10.4 # OK
```

To install our backend framework Flask, just follow [the instructions from the official website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) :wink:

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```sh
flask --version
> Python 3.10.4
> Flask 2.2.2
> Werkzeug 2.2.2 # OK
```

## MySQL

One thing is missing to our backend: a database!  
In this workshop, we'll use [**mysql**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04).

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```sh
mysql --version
> mysql   Ver 8.0.30-0ubuntu0.22.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu)) # OK
```


## Launching the server

```sh
python3 main.py
```
