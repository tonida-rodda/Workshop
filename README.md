# Workshop 29 - Backend Flask

In this workshop we will learn how to use the main functions of the http package in Python and how to create a REST API.

> :bulb: A quick [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis) about REST API.
## Step 0: Initialization

All the required information to install the workshop's dependencies are given in the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Step 1: let's get started

We designed a boilerplate for this project, it will be useful to start more easily but also to understand all the required parts of an API.  

There are plenty of other important packages you may need in a real API, but these are the main ones you can be sure you'll need one time or another. Now let's code :rocket:

Add a route on the endpoint `/`:
- It uses the `GET` method
- It responds `"hello world"`

> You can test it by going to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser or using `postman`

## Step 2: Register

You have succesfully created an endpoint!
The next step is to add register, yet we would like to know when a route is called to know if everything went well.

Create a emdpoint `/register`:
- It uses the `POST` method
- Store the data in the data base


## Step 3: Login

You have succesfully created an endpoint!
The next step is to add login, yet we would like to know when a route is called to know if everything went well.

Create a emdpoint `/login`:
- It uses the `POST` method
- Get the data from the data base

## Step 4: Add todo

The next step is to add add_todo, yet we would like to know when a route is called to know if everything went well.

Create a emdpoint `/add_todo`:
- It uses the `POST` method
- Store the data in the data base

## Step 5: Get todo

The next step is to add get_todo, yet we would like to know when a route is called to know if everything went well.

Create a emdpoint `/get_todo`:
- It uses the `POST` method
- Get the data from the data base
